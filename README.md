## About the Author:
Gaurav Mehan is a third-year Physics Student at UCL.

## Note about submission:
This project I completed after I had taken part in the UCL Data Science Society Hackathon 2019 - my first hackathon. With American Express and 
Microsoft as hosts, we were given a range of datasets and a broad outline on what we could do to improve business. My team and I didn't get far but I believe
then I knew next to nothing about Data Science. After a lot of reading up on Data Science and Machine Learning [Thank you Joel Grus], I embarked on my first Data Science Project.
Predicting whether or not a loan applicant would be successful. I based the foundations of this project from a submission in the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster [I know, classic] link here: https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions, which taught me a lot. 

## Data sources: 
As mentionned I recieved these datasets from the UCL Data Science Society Hackathon, and my understanding is that they are open-source. If for any reason they are not, I'm happy to take down the .csv files. 

### Enjoy, and thank you!
